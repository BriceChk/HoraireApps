# HoraireApps

This was my first Android project, back in 2017. First based off [matael/pytimeo](https://github.com/Matael/pytimeo), 
the app did some regex analysis of the results from the Setram Timeo server for the city of Le Mans (FR).

Then, the app (in the current code), used [this API](https://gist.github.com/outadoc/40060db45c436977a912).

Assets were generated by a Java program (TimeoAssetsGen) and used in the Android app.

Two apps were published on the Play Store:
- Horaires Setram (28/02/2017 - 01/2022) for Le Mans
- Horaires Irigo (10/08/2017 - 09/2018) for Angers, accompanied by a WearOS app

The Keolis API used by these apps is now closed. This repo serves as an archive for this project, as it was my first Android app made during high school.

The last update to this app was made in 2018 (previously in a private repository).
